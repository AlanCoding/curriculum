# TIY Python Curriculum

Repository for notebooks, slides, and thoughts about Python curriculum.

The curriculum is based on Python 3, which this repository assumes you are running.

**NOTE**: Only weeks 1-3 are reliable at this point. We have a lot of work to do on
later weeks.

## Tools

`.slides.md` files are slides and intended to be used with [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/).
