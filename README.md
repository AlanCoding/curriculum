# TIY Python Curriculum

Repository for notebooks, slides, and thoughts about Python curriculum.

The intention is that curriculum notes will live in [the wiki](https://github.com/theironyard/python-curriculum/wiki) while resources live in the repository.

The curriculum is based on Python 3, which this repository assumes you are running.
